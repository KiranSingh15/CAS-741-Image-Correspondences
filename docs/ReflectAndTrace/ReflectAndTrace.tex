  \item \textbf{Source of Feedback:} 
    \href{https://github.com/KiranSingh15/CAS-741-Image-Correspondences/issues/18}{GitHub Issue \#18} (AC12) and 
    \href{https://github.com/KiranSingh15/CAS-741-Image-Correspondences/issues/19}{GitHub Issue \#19} (AC13) \\
  \textbf{Issue Identified:} Both issues requested clarification on how anticipated changes (AC12 and AC13) impact software design. \\
  \textbf{Action Taken:} 
  \begin{itemize}
    \item AC12 was rewritten to emphasize the design implications rather than user interaction.
    \item AC13 was removed due to significant overlap with the revised AC12.
  \end{itemize}
  \textbf{Commit:} \href{https://github.com/KiranSingh15/CAS-741-Image-Correspondences/commit/f7b81b48841c440ab665efb53fc0c8291c9c0e53}{f7b81b4}

  \item \textbf{Source of Feedback:} \href{https://github.com/KiranSingh15/CAS-741-Image-Correspondences/issues/20}{GitHub Issue \#20} \\
  \textbf{Issue Identified:} The Control Module was described as an abstract data type rather than an abstract object. \\
  \textbf{Action Taken:} The description of the Control Module was revised to reflect it as an abstract object. \\
  \textbf{Commit:} \href{https://github.com/KiranSingh15/CAS-741-Image-Correspondences/commit/b71d13a22a609f3a48efb7fa22a8fe5f681868c5}{b71d13a}

  \item \textbf{Source of Feedback:} GitHub Issue \#21 \\
  \textbf{Issue Identified:} Tuning parameters in Sections 8.3 and 8.4 were redundantly defined as both exported constants and state variables. \\
  \textbf{Action Taken:} Removed state variable definitions to retain only exported constants. \\
  \textbf{Commit:} \href{https://github.com/KiranSingh15/CAS-741-Image-Correspondences/commit/9f9e07a572e2f0db97f3e057f998ba9bad0d9189}{9f9e07a}

  \item \textbf{Source of Feedback:} GitHub Issue \#21 \\
  \textbf{Issue Identified:} Suggested that method variables (e.g., \texttt{mthd\_...}) in Section 8.3.1 should be booleans. \\
  \textbf{Action Taken:} Suggestion was kindly rejected. Method identifiers remain as integers to support enumerated selections for future extensibility. \\
  \textbf{Commit:} Not applicable (no change implemented)

  \item \textbf{Source of Feedback:} GitHub Issue \#21 \\
  \textbf{Issue Identified:} \texttt{make\_directory(folder\_name)} in Section 9.4.4 did not clarify its effect on environment variables. \\
  \textbf{Action Taken:} Semantics were updated to specify that this function causes an environment variable transition. \\
  \textbf{Commit:} \href{https://github.com/KiranSingh15/CAS-741-Image-Correspondences/commit/9f9e07a572e2f0db97f3e057f998ba9bad0d9189}{9f9e07a}

\section{Challenge Level and Extras}
\subsection{Challenge Level}
This project is defined as an advanced research project. The output of the \progname{} software form the front end of a robust optimization algorithm for extrinsic camera calibration. The framework of this software will be iterated upon during the Summer 2025 development period and beyond to collect meaningful input data to test the backend of the optimization software.
\subsection{Extras}
No extra deliverables will be delivered with this project.

\section{Design Iteration (LO11 (PrototypeIterate))}

\plt{Explain how you arrived at your final design and implementation.  How did
the design evolve from the first version to the final version?} 

\plt{Don't just say what you changed, say why you changed it.  The needs of the
client should be part of the explanation.  For example, if you made changes in
response to usability testing, explain what the testing found and what changes
it led to.}

\section{Design Decisions (LO12)}

\plt{Reflect and justify your design decisions.  How did limitations,
 assumptions, and constraints influence your decisions?  Discuss each of these
 separately.}

\section{Economic Considerations (LO23)}

\plt{Is there a market for your product? What would be involved in marketing your 
product? What is your estimate of the cost to produce a version that you could 
sell?  What would you charge for your product?  How many units would you have to 
sell to make money? If your product isn't something that would be sold, like an 
open source project, how would you go about attracting users?  How many potential 
users currently exist?}

\section{Reflection on Project Management (LO24)}

\plt{This question focuses on processes and tools used for project management.}

\subsection{How Does Your Project Management Compare to Your Development Plan}

\plt{Did you follow your Development plan, with respect to the team meeting plan, 
team communication plan, team member roles and workflow plan.  Did you use the 
technology you planned on using?}

\subsection{What Went Well?}

\plt{What went well for your project management in terms of processes and 
technology?}

\subsection{What Went Wrong?}

\plt{What went wrong in terms of processes and technology?}

\subsection{What Would you Do Differently Next Time?}

\plt{What will you do differently for your next project?}
