\section{Introduction}
Camera sensors are a common choice of sensor for many applications in robotics due 
in part to their low cost and ease of integration. Prior to their use, each camera 
must be calibrated such that collected data in collected imagery can be aligned with 
the 3D world. This process is essential to prepare the system so that 
imagery data can be correctly captured and processed for downstream operations.

Camera calibration consists of two aspects; intrinsic calibration and extrinsic 
calibration. Intrinsic calibration focuses on mapping the 2D camera image 
to the 3D camera frame, Extrinsic calibration converts the 3D camera frame
to a global world frame. Extrinsic calibration is of significant interest as  
operators may need to reposition cameras on a robotic platforms for any number of 
operational needs.

The following section outlines the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for 
a calibration algorithm that calculates the extrinsic parameters for a multi-camera 
robotic platform. The program is therefore named \progname, 
or IFC.


\subsection{Purpose of Document}

This document is the primary resource for the user to outline the desired 
characteristics of the user, the required system interfaces, and desired 
integrated behaviour of the IFC algorithm. The goals and key assumptions of the
desired software are outlined, in addition to the required definitions, 
theoretical models and instance models required to support its development. 
Specifically, theoretical models are outlined to provide a framework to promote 
development such that a specific design solution is not imposed at an early stage 
of development. The SRS is abstract - it bounds what problems need to be solved by 
the system, rather than how it needs to be achieved.

Following a standard waterfall development model, this document will be used as a 
stepping to support the development of several additional documents, each of which 
demonstrates successive growth in the understanding and maturation of the software 
product. These documents include:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The Design Specification: An outline of the architectural decisions that 
  details   how the requirements will be realized in the system. This is inclusive 
  of the choice of operating environment, system interfaces with the user and its 
  environment, and the   numerical methods that shall be implemented.

  \item The Verification and Validation (V\&V) Plan: An outline of the specific processess 
  to be used to assess the implementation of the code as developed from the Design 
  Specification. Verification assessments will be used to assess whether the system has been 
  built to the specified requirements from the SRS. Validation tests may also be outlined to 
  ensure that the software correctly addresses the problem as defined in  build confidence 
  that the   design has satisfied the outlined requirements per Section \ref{Header_Req}.
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Scope of Requirements} 
The outlined requirements includes conventional imagery processing algorithms. When supplied 
with the permissible inputs, the IFC software shall scan imagery data to and 
identify match candidates amongst each image for various cameras and robot poses. The entire 
document is written under the assumption that the imagery scene is free of significant changes 
in ambient illumination during imagery capture.

\subsection{Characteristics of Intended Reader} \label{sec_IntendedReader}
% Addressed comment to specify characteristics of desired reader from Rev 1.0
Readers of this document should have a introductory understanding of robot mechanics and 
engineering statistics, which may typically be provided in a 3rd or 4th year undergraduate course. They 
should also have a strong comprehension of image processing algorithms, which may consist of 
material covered in a 4th-year undergraduate or Master's level course in computer vision 
algorithms. The reader should have an understanding of robot mechanics 
Table \ref{Table_UserChar} outlines examples of courses that satisfy 
the desired prerequisite knowledge criteria for the reader.

\subsection{Organization of Document}
The remainder of the document uses a top-down structure that outlines, in order, 
the goals, assumptions, theories, definitions, and instance models. These 
components are then used to derive the functional and non-functional requirements. 
Goal statements and assumptions are sequentially distilled into theoretical models, 
definitions, instance models, and finally to requirements.

The reader can glean value through review of the instance models prior to 
the theoretical models, as the instance models outlne an operational specification of 
system behaviour, rather than a descriptive specification. This enables flexibility 
in what theoretical models are applied as they may be selected as inputs to the 
systems as a functional program. 

\section{General System Description}

This section provides general information about the system.  It identifies the
interfaces between the system and its environment, describes the user
characteristics and lists the system constraints.

\subsection{System Context}
Figure \ref{Fig_SystemContext} depicts the system context. A rectangle represents 
the IFC software itself, whereas circles depict interactions with stakeholders, 
namely the user. Arrowheads are used to demonstrate the sequential flow of data 
between the software system and the environment.

\begin{itemize}
\item User Responsibilities:
\item % Updated bullets to reflect the input as camera data
\begin{itemize}
\item Provide camera images to the system
\item Specific the desired methods of image smoothing, keypoint identification, definition of features from keypoints, and comparison of features
\item Refine the tuning parameters used for each of the specified processes
\item Verify that the input data is contained in the correct data structures
\item Configure the type of feature-handler algorithms to be used with corresponding 
threshold criteria
\end{itemize}
\item \progname{} Responsibilities:
\begin{itemize}
\item Detect data type mismatch, such as a string of characters instead of a floating point number
\item Assess whether inputs constitute a fully defined physical setup
\item Calculate match candidates between two images
\item Provide a quality metric of confidence in the calculated outputs
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
This software is not intended for use in safety-critical applications. If it is required for 
applications that are deemed to be safety-critical, then the software will need to undergo a new 
review and verification cycle.

\subsection{User Characteristics} \label{SecUserCharacteristics}
% updated per feedback on SRS Rev 1.0
As the intent of this software is intended to be used primarily in a research environment, 
the intended user is expected to posses a similar prerequisite knowledge base as that of the 
intended reader of the SRS, as outlined in Section \ref{sec_IntendedReader}. Therefore, the 
user of the IFC software should be familiar with the following prerequisite material outlined 
in Table \ref{Table_UserChar} prior to use of the software. 

\subsection{System Constraints}
The IFC software shall be compatible with Python 3.1 libraries, such as
OpenCV.

\section{Specific System Description}
This section first presents the problem description, which gives a high-level
view of the problem to be solved.  This is followed by the solution characteristics
specification, which presents the assumptions, theories, definitions and finally
the instance models. 

\subsection{Problem Description} \label{Sec_pd}

\progname{} is intended to evaluate how imagery data from robot-based cameras can 
can be manipulated to define and align features between separate images in support 
of downstream operations for extrinsic camera calibration.

\subsubsection{Terminology and  Definitions}

This subsection provides a list of terms that are used in the subsequent

easier to correctly understand the requirements:

\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{Features:} distinctive patterns or structures in an image that are 
identifiable and useful for matching between images

\item \textbf{Keypoints:} specific pixel locations in an image that represent 
significant and repeatable features
\item \textbf{Correspondences:} pairs of keypoints between two images that represent 
represent the same real-world point
% typo updated
\item \textbf{Extrinsic Parameters:} the transform between the 3D camera frame to the 
3D world frame.
\item \textbf{Intrinsic Parameters:} camera parameters that pertain to the transform of the 
2D image plane frame to the 3D camera frame
\item \textbf{Hand-eye:} the relation between the robot end-effector to the camera frame
\item \textbf{Robot-world:} the relation between the robot base frame to the world frame
\item \textbf{Pose:} refers to the position and orientation of an object, sensor, or robot in $SE(3)$
\item \textbf{Patch:} a region of defined size ($p_{sz} \times p_{sz}$) that is used to compare pixels and define a feature descriptor
\end{itemize}

\noindent\label{PS_2}PS2: Known base-to-hand transform.\\
\noindent\label{PS_3}PS3: Projected camera images from distinct camera poses.\\ \\
The physical system of \progname{}, as shown in Figure \ref{Wang_EOH}, outlines 
case of a single-camera, single target configuration (PS1). This outlines the frames of 
interest for for the broader problem formulation. \\

\end{figure}
\noindent The single-camera configuration can be extrapolated to the multi-camera, multi-target case (PS2), as shown in Figure \ref{OASIS}, from which a representation of equivalent keypoints between images (PS3) is shown in Figure \ref{MV_HZ}. The formulation in Figure \ref{MV_HZ} is what will be addressed by the IFC software.\\

Description & 
$G_{2D}$ represents the 2D Gaussian kernel function applied to a grayscale image

The variables $u$ and $v$ denote the horizontal and vertical distances from the kernel center, respectively (both are unitless). 
The parameter $\sigma$ represents the standard deviation of the Gaussian distribution, which controls the amount of smoothing applied. 
This kernel is convolved with the image to reduce high-frequency noise and enhance regional uniformity. \\

$\mathit{d_k}$ represents the $k^{th}$ bit in the BRIEF descriptor. 
For each bit, two points $p_{k1}'$ and $p_{k2}'$ are selected within a patch centered at the keypoint.

\subsubsection*{Detailed derivation of Rotated Brief Transform}
$\mathit{p_{k}}$ and $\mathit{q_{k}}$ are calculated by successive increments of a 12\textdegree. 
The transform between $\mathit{p_{k}^{'}}$ and $\mathit{q_{k}^{'}}$ is outlined below, where $\theta$ 
represents the increase in rotation by a denomination of 12\textdegree. \\

\[
\begin{bmatrix} p_k' \\ q_k' \end{bmatrix} =
\begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & -\sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & \cos\theta \end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix} p_k \\ q_k \end{bmatrix}

\subsubsection{Input Data Constraints} \label{sec_DataConstraints}    

Table~\ref{TblInputVar} shows the data constraints on the input output
variables.  The column for physical constraints gives the physical limitations
on the range of values that can be taken by the variable.  The column for
software constraints restricts the range of inputs to reasonable values.  The
software constraints will be helpful in the design stage for picking suitable
algorithms.  The constraints are conservative, to give the user of the model the
flexibility to experiment with unusual situations.  The column of typical values
is intended to provide a feel for a common scenario.  The uncertainty column
provides an estimate of the confidence with which the physical quantities can be
measured.  This information would be part of the input if one were performing an
uncertainty quantification exercise.

The specification parameters are outlined in Table~\ref{TblInputVar}.

\begin{table}[!h]

\item[(*)] standard deviation, $\sigma$, is constrained to be positive and real

\end{description}

\subsubsection{Properties of a Correct Solution} \label{sec_CorrectSolution}

\noindent
Each image needs to be assessed such that it is invariant to the order for which it is processed by the software. In other words, the output of the \progname{} software should be deterministic. Each identified keypoint needs to have an associated set of pixel coordinates. Each descriptor needs to have an associated keypoint and unique identifier. Each candidate match between features needs to have associated keypoints, descriptors, and identifiers for the points of origin of both consituitive images.

\noindent
\\
\\
As it stands, there are currently no 
identified physical constraints on the system.


\section{Requirements}\label{Header_Req}
This section provides the functional requirements, the business tasks that the
software is expected to complete, and the nonfunctional requirements, the
qualities that the software is expected to exhibit.

\subsection{Functional Requirements}

\noindent \begin{itemize}

% Inputs
\item[R\refstepcounter{reqnum}\thereqnum \label{R_Update_SD}:] The IFC software shall accept 
updates to the variance in image noise,  $\mathit{\sigma}$, upon user input.

\item[R\refstepcounter{reqnum}\thereqnum \label{R_Update_Intensity}:] The IFC software shall accept 
updates to the image intensity threshold, $\mathit{t}$, upon user input.

\item[R\refstepcounter{reqnum}\thereqnum \label{R_Default_Noise}:] The IFC software shall use a 
default noise suppresion parameter of $\sigma = 1$ if no option is specified by the user.

\item[R\refstepcounter{reqnum}\thereqnum \label{R_Default_FD}:] The IFC software shall use corner 
detection as the default feature detection method if no option is specified by the user.

\item[R\refstepcounter{reqnum}\thereqnum \label{R_Default_KD}:] The IFC software shall use binary 
descriptors as the default keypoint descriptor method if no option is specified by the user.

\item[R\refstepcounter{reqnum}\thereqnum \label{R_Default_FM}:] The IFC software shall use compare 
feature descriptors by their Hamming Distance if no alternative descriptor matching method 
is specified by the user.

% Calculations 
\item[R\refstepcounter{reqnum}\thereqnum \label{R_NoiseReduction}:] The IFC software shall 
implement noise reduction on an input greyscale image per a prescribed standard deviation (from 
\iref{IM_GK}).

\item[R\refstepcounter{reqnum}\thereqnum \label{R_DetectKeypoints}:] The IFC software shall, given a 2D 
greyscale image, define a set of keypoints per the alloted threshold criteria (from 
\iref{IM_FAST_Detect}).

\item[R\refstepcounter{reqnum}\thereqnum \label{R_DefineDescriptors}:] The IFC software shall 
define feature descriptors from identified keypoints (from \iref{IM_BRIEF_Desc}).

\item[R\refstepcounter{reqnum}\thereqnum \label{R_CompareDescriptors}:] The IFC software shall 
identify matches between descriptors that originate from separate images (from \iref{IM_Dist_Hamm}).

\item[R\refstepcounter{reqnum}\thereqnum \label{R_DistinctImages}:] The IFC software shall review 
all identified feature matches to confirm that they originate from separate images.

% Outputs 
% Verify Outputs
\item[R\refstepcounter{reqnum}\thereqnum \label{R_UniqueMatch_IDs}:] The IFC software shall report 
that all feature correspondences are uniquely defined by two respective sets of cameras and pose 
frames as an output.

\item[R\refstepcounter{reqnum}\thereqnum \label{R_OutputCorrespondences}:] The IFC software shall report 
the identified matches between features, with corresponding camera and pose identifiers, as an output.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Nonfunctional Requirements}

\noindent \begin{itemize}

\item[NFR\refstepcounter{nfrnum}\thenfrnum \label{NFR_Rel_1}:] \textbf{Reliability}
The IFC software shall be invariant to the order that imagery data is provided to the feature 
matching process.

\item[NFR\refstepcounter{nfrnum}\thenfrnum \label{NFR_Use_1}:] \textbf{Usability}
The IFC system shall provide an interface that at least 80\% of its users would describe 
as 'simple to use' based on direct feedback.

\item[NFR\refstepcounter{nfrnum}\thenfrnum \label{NFR_Mtn_1}:] \textbf{Maintainability}
The IFC software should support implementation of new feature detection methods within 30\% 
of the total time effort required to develop the default method of feature detection.

\item[NFR\refstepcounter{nfrnum}\thenfrnum \label{NFR_Perf_1}:] \textbf{Performance}
The IFC software should report timing metrics for each image processing operation.

\item[NFR\refstepcounter{nfrnum}\thenfrnum \label{NFR_Perf_2}:] \textbf{Performance}
The system should report the average and maximum memory used during each operation.


\end{itemize}

\subsection{Rationale}

The scope and assumptions of this document are intended to encapsulate a realistic problem formulation 
software. This software is intended for use in laboratory experimentation and configurations, rather than 
as an off-the-shelf product for applications that involve more risk, such as those that are safety-critical 
or mission critical in scope.\\ \\
A\ref{A_min_num_cameras} is necessary at it enables flexibility to developers to scale the software to the case of multiple cameras in the event that the use case of a single camera can be successfully implemented. However, it does not specify that support for multiple cameras is necessary. A\ref{A_camera_model} is necessary as all imagery needs to be projected on a 2D affine plane as the software is not intended to be used with imagery that is procurred using a fish-eye lens. A\ref{A_greyscale} is necessary as it significant reduces the complexity of computation that is required to process colour imagery. Conversion to greyscale is a standard industrial practice for image processing. A\ref{A_RT_Memory} is necessary to avoid imposing timing and performance constraints on the software. This would consitute the need to perform a hazard analysis to address safety and performance challenges that would arise from operating in a real-time scenario. 

\section{Likely Changes} 
\noindent \begin{itemize}

\item[LC\refstepcounter{lcnum}\thelcnum\label{LC_keypoint_method}:] 
The theoretical model of keypoint detection will be abstracted to expand the types of 
implementation models that can be used.

\item[LC\refstepcounter{lcnum}\thelcnum\label{LC_descriptor_method}:] 
The theoretical model of assigning feature descriptors will be abstracted to expand the types of 
implementation models that can be used.

\item[LC\refstepcounter{lcnum}\thelcnum\label{LC_comparison_method}:] 
The theoretical model of descriptor matching will be abstracted to expand the types of 
implementation models that can be used.

\end{itemize}

\section{Unlikely Changes}    

\noindent \begin{itemize}

\item[LC\refstepcounter{lcnum}\thelcnum\label{RGB_Data}:] It is unlikely that the design 
will need to be adjusted to perform computation on RGB data instead of grayscale data.

\end{itemize}

\section{Traceability Matrices and Graphs}

The purpose of the traceability matrices is to provide easy references on what
has to be additionally modified if a certain component is changed.  Every time a
component is changed, the items in the column of that component that are marked
with an ``X'' may have to be modified as well.  Table~\ref{Table:trace} shows the
dependencies of theoretical models, general definitions, data definitions, and
instance models with each other. Table~\ref{Table:R_trace} shows the
dependencies of instance models, requirements, and data constraints on each
other. Table~\ref{Table:A_trace} shows the dependencies of theoretical models,
general definitions, data definitions, instance models, and likely changes on
the assumptions.
